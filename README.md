CoRED
=====

CoRED is a web-based collaborative real-time editor for software development.
That is, an editor where multiple people can edit the same code at the same time
using nothing more than a web browser. See [cored.cs.tut.fi](http://cored.cs.tut.fi).

**NOTE**: the development on CoRED is continued in another project, **[MIDEaaS](https://github.com/ahn/mideaas)**. (Sorry about the confusion of different project names, hopefully we can do something about that...)

### How to use

CoRED uses Maven to handle dependencies.
An Eclipse project is included in the repository.

A proper description of the contents of this repository and how to use it hopefully coming "soon".
In the meantime, please contact [Antti and Janne](mailto:antti.h.nieminen@tut.fi,janne.lautamaki@tut.fi).
